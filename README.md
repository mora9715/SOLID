# SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles in software development. Following these principles allows writing more transparent, extendable, and reusable code.
From my experience, the principles show their best with Object-Oriented Design.

The patterns were actively promoted by Robert C. Martin in the late 90s.
